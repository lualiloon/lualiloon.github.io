## Welcome to the crypt

This is where I will bring my old, forgotten projects back to life. 

We'll explore my abandoned creative endevors, to see how my skills and ideas have developed over time. You'll find everything here - spaghetti code, terrible art, unfinished design docs, and more. I'm hoping we'll stumble upon some hidden gems, but there's no guarantee. I'll do my best to showcase and document these projects, even (especially) the awkward, embarrassing ones.

My goal is to give you a glimpse into the creative development process and show you how ideas and abilities can evolve. I am in no way finished, to be frank I haven't even released a completed game yet. But I have still come a long way from where I started. I hope you'll find this section helpful and inspiring, especially if you're on a similar creative journey. Let's face it - things can get messy, we can fail, but we can also learn and grow from our experiences. So, join me on this adventure, and let's have some fun!
