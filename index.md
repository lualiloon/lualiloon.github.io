## Welcome to my game design playground! 

This is where I experiment with game design ideas and showcase my past projects.

I've been fascinated with game design for years. I love creating worlds, characters, and mechanics that players can immerse themselves in. This website is my way of sharing that passion.

### Monthly Projects

Every month, I create a brand new project and share it through [my latest post](/). It might be a quick prototype, a mini-game, or something completely different. I want to push myself to continually create new things, and share the process with you.

### The Crypt

In addition to my monthly projects, I'll also be digging up my old projects and adding them to [The Crypt](/crypt.html). This is where you can find all my forgotten work -- old code, bad art, unfinished design docs. It's a place to explore my past projects and see how skills and ideas can develope over time.

### Let's Explore

Game design is all about experimentation, iteration, and learning. My hope is that this can be a place for us to learn and grow together, as we explore interactive experiences and ignite imagination.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy your time here!
