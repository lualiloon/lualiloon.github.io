I'm dealing with a lot right now, and I don't have the capacity to write a full post. So instead, here's what I'm building help prototype my game. It's not much yet, just some grass tiles and the ability to walk around, but it's a start.

(Click anywhere on the grass to activate input, then you can walk around with w-a-s-d. Sorry, doesn't work on mobile or touch screens.)
