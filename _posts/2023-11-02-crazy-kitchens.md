This month was a bit crazy. I spent so much time dealing with real life bureaucracies, and it completely sapped my energy for anything creative. I really didn't want to [miss another month]({% post_url 2023-10-02-didnt-happen %}), so I spent two days whipping up an itsy bitsy project to share.

I wanted this project to be about the fun of experimenting in the kitchen. The satisfaction of trying things, answering questions like "What if I put turmeric in my oatmeal?" (Haven't tried that one yet, but I promise to report back as soon as I do). 

The result is an experiment that's really too small to capture that feeling, but it's a start.

(Quick note for anyone on mobile: The touch controls aren't super intuitive, but it does work.)
