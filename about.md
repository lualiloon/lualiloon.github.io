## This is a place to catalogue my creative work

### I am starting with the past

I will be digging up my old code, projects, ideas. All the things I've done over the past few years: good, bad, doesn't matter. The point is to have a place where it's all together, to get a sense of where I started and how far I've come.

I have a tendency to be frustrated with my current skills -- I forget where I started and how much I have done to get to where I am. This will be a place to look back on the journey I've taken, the things I've done. It won't be a perfect recreation; reconstructing the past never is. But I hope it will be enough to get back on track when I need a push.
