    <h2 id="welcome-to-my-game-design-playground">Welcome to my game design playground!</h2>

<p>This is where I experiment with game design ideas and showcase my past projects.</p>

<p>I’ve been fascinated with game design for years. I love creating worlds, characters, and mechanics that players can immerse themselves in. This website is my way of sharing that passion with you.</p>

<h3 id="monthly-projects">Monthly Projects</h3>

<p>Every month, I’ll post a new update with a small project I’ve been working on. These projects could be anything from a quick prototype to a mini-game. My goal is to challenge myself to create something new every month, and share the process with you.</p>

<h3 id="the-crypt">The Crypt</h3>

<p>In addition to my monthly projects, I’ll also be digging up my old projects and adding them to <a href="/crypt.html">The Crypt</a>. This is where you can find all my forgotten work – old code, bad art, unfinished design docs. It’s a place to explore my past projects and see how skills and ideas can develope over time.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>I believe that game design is all about experimentation, iteration, and learning. My hope is that this website can be a place for us to learn and grow together, as we explore the wonderful world of game design.</p>

<p>Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy your time here!</p>
